*knotty* benefits from the following open-source libraries:

  #. *bamtools* (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools). An elegant C++ API for reading, writing, and manipulating sequence alignments in the BAM format. Author: Derek Barnett.
  #. *bwa* (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). *knotty* uses the stdaln library developed by Heng Li as part of the BWA package.  This library is used to generate a consensus sequence from overlapping read pairs.
